# Top StoryTime

## Description

 - This was a practice take-home assessment assigned by [Turing School of Software and Design](www.turing.edu).  We were given 6-8 hours to demonstrate our React & Front End skills by completing an app that renders top stories from the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview). This was meant to simulate what a take home assessment for an interview would be like, and we also had time dedicated to presenting to instructors and fellow classmates.

### Deploy Instructions

- Clone down this repo
- `cd` into the directory
- Run `npm i` on your Terminal/command line to install dependencies
- Run `npm start`
- If it doesn't automatically open in browser, visit `localhost:3000`

### Notable features

 - Built using React framework
 - Use of Router to enable user to navigate using back and forward browser controls.
 - Utilized responsive design for mobile, tablet or desktop viewing
 - 100% Lighthouse accessibility score
 - `aria-label`s added for better screen reader capability

  - First time using Adobe XD as a new wireframing tool! It seems very similar to Figma, but with extra Adobe Suite integration (ex. placing in SVGs from Adobe Illustrator)

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrate mastery of React & Front End and best practices
- Get practice with take home assessments and presenting and talking about code in front of others!
